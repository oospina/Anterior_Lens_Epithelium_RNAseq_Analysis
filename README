# Gene expression analysis of eye lens epithelium and corneal endothelium

This repository contains scripts associated with the analysis of bulk RNA-seq data used in 
the manuscript entitled: *Exploring the potential of anterior lens capsule epithelial cells as a 
substitute for corneal endothelial cells for cell therapies*. Data used in this code is 
stored in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) ([GSE307473](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE307473)). 
Whenever possible and/or relevant, intermediate or result files are included in this repository. 
Unix and R code was contributed by Oscar Ospina. 

The .fastq files from Illumina outputs were processed using the [nf-core/rnaseq pipeline](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/). 
Multiple R packages were used to analyze the gene expression matrices generated by nf-core/rnaseq,
including tximport and DESeq2.
